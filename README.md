## Developers

Set up a development environment:

* Make sure Java8 is available.
* Make sure you have a MongoDB, MySQL or MariaDB database running.
* Compile with `make all`
* Get the [obiba-home](https://github.com/obiba/obiba-home) repository to have some seeding material.
* Prepare execution environment: `make prepare` (do it only once, this will create a opal_home directory)
* Run in debug mode: `make debug`
* Login http://localhost:8080 with administrator/password credentials.
* Declare the databases (only at the first connection)
* Go to _obiba-home_ project and `make seed-opal`

There are many other targets, just check the _Makefile_ and change variables to match your environment.
